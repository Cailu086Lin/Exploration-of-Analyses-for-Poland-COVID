The primary results suggest that the COVID patients who experience a loss of taste or smell tend
to increase their salt intake and reduce their sugar/sweetener intake.

To determine the true difference between the two groups, it is
important to adjust for sex and age as covariates. Including these
covariates can strengthen the results by accounting for their
potential influence on taste and smell, enabling the model to more
accurately isolate the effects of the primary variables.

Several statistical methods can achieve the goal. Given the small
sample size, advanced statistical methods and resampling techniques
can provide more robust insights.
